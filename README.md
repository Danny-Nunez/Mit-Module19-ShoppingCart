# Mit-Module19-ShoppingCart

In Module 19: Shopping Cart Exercise, We learned how to integrate a React front end with the back end and we also learned how to use tools like Strapi, Postman, Express, and node. Youâ€™ll use Strapi to create a Database, then use Express and Postman to set up and test the communication between Strapi and the front end. We also utilized picsum api to random generate new image on load.
